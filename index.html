      <h2>Batik: More Than a Fabric</h2>
      <p>
        Javanese batik isn’t just fabric, it is a part of culture you can wear. Each piece carries stories about kings and queens, old myths, and things from nature. The patterns are drawn by hand with hot wax, and every design has its own meaning, showing your family status, which village or palace you’re from, or even something personal about your life. The colors, often made from plants deep blue from indigo, brown from the soga tree, so the cloth feels tied to the land and long-held traditions. Keeping the old way of making batik alive matters a lot as it protects the culture and gives work to the artisans who still do everything by hand.
